### Installing a new Wireless Network Manager
I have had a problem with getting the wireless adapter to connect to both my home and the University networks using the default wireless service in Raspbian. The only, and probably the easiest, way to get around this is to install a new wireless networking service called, wicd. To do this just run the following at the command prompt:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wicd
```
